Impact of Heatwaves on the Arceye Hawkfish
================
by Tong Ning, Miriam Bergeron, Ryan Gleason, and Moreblessing Banda

## Summary

The study focused on the effect of heatwaves on coral reef fish. The study was conducted by Van Wert et al. and was published on July 15, 2024. The Hawkfish were collected in Mo'orea, French Polynesia in 2019 during the winter and 2022 during the summer. They studied how marine heatwaves impacted the performance and thermal tolerance of the arceye hawkfish, which is a tropical predatory fish. The purpose of our analysis of this study was to understand the impact that heat waves have on arceye hawkfish and their functioning. With that information, we were able to comprehend the relation between ocean temperatures and the performance of arceye hawkfish, and theorize the larger impact of climate change on marine populations. 

## Methods

The researchers used five temperature treatments (27, 28, 29, 31, or 33°C) for one week to test hawkfish’s acclimation ability, which they measured by metabolic performance metrics, including maximum metabolic rate (MMR), standard metabolic rate (SMR), and costs of digestion (specific dynamic action, SDA), using respirometry chambers. A subset of fish and wild fish were tested for thermal tolerance using an acute cardiac thermal tolerance test. The metabolic data were processed in R and the heart rate data were processed in LabChart.

## Analysis

## Conclusions

Through our analysis of the Van Wert et al. (2024) study and our plots, we were able to understand the relationship between ocean temperatures and the functioning of hawkfish. The plots reveal at higher temperatures, hawkfish have lower maximum metabolic rates, suggesting that the high temperatures cause the fish to experience thermal stress as a result of expending too much energy. Additionally, hawkfish have lower aerobic scopes at warmer temperatures, meaning they are more strained in the summer than in the winter. Additionally, the maximum metabolic rate of hawkfish differs across body weight and season, as heavier fish in the summer have much lower maximum metabolic rates, suggesting
