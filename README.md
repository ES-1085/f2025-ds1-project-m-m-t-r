Impact of Heatwaves on the Arceye Hawkfish
================
by Tong Ning, Miriam Bergeron, Ryan Gleason, and Moreblessing Banda

## Summary

The study focused on the effect of heatwaves on coral reef fish. The study was conducted by Van Wert et al. and was published on July 15, 2024. The Hawkfish were collected in Mo'orea, French Polynesia in 2019 during the winter and 2022 during the summer. They studied how marine heatwaves impacted the performance and thermal tolerance of the arceye hawkfish, which is a tropical predatory fish. The purpose of our analysis of this study was to understand the impact that heat waves have on arceye hawkfish and their functioning. With that information, we were able to comprehend the relation between ocean temperatures and the performance of arceye hawkfish, and theorize the larger impact of climate change on marine populations. 

## Methods

The researchers used five temperature treatments (27, 28, 29, 31, or 33°C) for one week to test hawkfish’s acclimation ability, which they measured by metabolic performance metrics, including maximum metabolic rate (MMR), standard metabolic rate (SMR), and costs of digestion (specific dynamic action, SDA), using respirometry chambers. A subset of fish and wild fish were tested for thermal tolerance using an acute cardiac thermal tolerance test. The metabolic data were processed in R and the heart rate data were processed in LabChart.

## Analysis

## Conclusions

Through our analysis of the Van Wert et al. (2024) study and our plots, we were able to understand the relationship between marine heatwaves and the functioning of hawkfish. The plots reveal at higher temperatures, hawkfish have lower maximum metabolic rates, suggesting that the high temperatures cause the fish to experience thermal stress as a result of expending too much energy. Additionally, hawkfish have lower aerobic scopes at warmer temperatures, meaning they are more strained in the summer than in the winter. Additionally, the maximum metabolic rate of hawkfish differs across body weight and season, as heavier fish have lower maximum metabolic rates, suggesting they are disproportionately impacted by the high temperatures compared to smaller fish. Overall, marine heatwaves significantly restrict the arceye hawkfish’s energy output and performance, posing a great threat to their functioning.

While Van Wert et al. (2024) provided a strong foundation for our project, there were limitations to the conclusions we were able to draw from the data. Because the data was collected in one year, there was not a strong emphasis on the long-term impacts of marine heatwaves on the health of hawkfish, which prevented us from charting the possible deterioration of the fish over time. Additionally, studying the fish over multiple years or decades would have allowed for an analysis of the frequency of heatwaves. Recent research has found that, due to climate change, both the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves is increasing (Marcos et al., 2025). Thus, we recommend that future research explores the interaction between hawkfish and marine heatwaves over an extended period, to better understand how climate change will continue to harm hawkfish. Additionally, Van Wert et al.’s population of hawkfish lived only in Mo’orea, French Polynesia. Future research could look at the frequency of marine heatwaves across the globe, to identify areas that have usually high frequencies of heatwaves, to understand how different populations of marine animals will be affected by heatwaves.
